# Overhead-Cube-Detection-from-Drone-Images

This project was part of the Inter IIT Tech meet in Dec 2019, where the task was to detect green cubes spread across a green grassy field. A suitable dataset for using machine learning was not found. So instead, the code uses feature extraction after changing color spaces and using filters like the Bilateral Filter, Hough lines, etc. to detect the cubes on a similar colored background. 

# Some examples of the code output from photos I took from a drone
The black box around the cube was drawn by the code after successful detection
