# Overhead-Cube-Detection-from-Drone-Images

This project was part of the Inter IIT Tech meet in Dec 2019, where the task was to detect green cubes spread across a green grassy field. A suitable dataset for using machine learning was not found. So, instead the code detects boxes using the feature extraction after changing color spaces and using filters like the Bilateral Filter, Hough lines, etc.
